# üéØ PRE-EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS & CHECKLIST

## ‚úÖ CURRENT STATUS VERIFICATION

### Database Status
- [x] **PostgreSQL 17.6** running and accessible
- [x] **Database is completely clean** (0 tables confirmed)
- [x] **Connection string** configured in environment variables
- [x] **No background services** running on database

### Codebase Status  
- [x] **Cleanup completed** (27 issues fixed)
- [x] **Schema imports standardized** (all using comprehensive-schema.ts)
- [x] **Migration files removed** (clean slate approach)
- [x] **Old references cleaned** (no conflicting schema files)

### Environment Setup
- [x] **Node.js 18+** available
- [x] **npm/npx** commands working
- [x] **TypeScript** compilation available
- [x] **Drizzle Kit** installed and configured

## üö® CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS BEFORE EXECUTION

### 1. Environment Variables (MUST VERIFY)
```bash
# Check these are set in your .env file:
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_USER=your_username  
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
POSTGRES_DATABASE=driveuk_db
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
```

**Verification Command:**
```bash
npx tsx -e "console.log('DB:', process.env.POSTGRES_DATABASE, 'Host:', process.env.POSTGRES_HOST)"
```

### 2. PostgreSQL Connection Test
```bash
# This should work without errors:
npx tsx lib/db/check-database-state.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ Connected to PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL 17.6...
‚ùå No tables found - Database appears to be empty
```

### 3. Schema File Validation
```bash
# Check main schema file exists:
ls -la lib/db/comprehensive-schema.ts
```

**Expected:** File should exist and be the main schema file

### 4. Available Scripts Check
```bash
# Verify these commands exist:
npm run build
npx drizzle-kit push  
npx tsx lib/db/safe-seed.ts
```

## üìã EXECUTION READINESS CHECKLIST

### Pre-Execution Safety Checks
- [ ] **Backup created** of critical files (optional but recommended)
- [ ] **Terminal clear** and ready for execution
- [ ] **No other database operations** running
- [ ] **Development server stopped** (if running)
- [ ] **All files saved** in VS Code

### Phase 1 Prerequisites
- [ ] **Schema modifications** ready to implement
- [ ] **Understanding of risks** (schema changes affect everything)
- [ ] **Validation plan** ready (check each fix immediately)

### Phase 2 Prerequisites  
- [ ] **Phase 1 completed** successfully
- [ ] **No TypeScript errors** from schema changes
- [ ] **Seed data understanding** (field mappings critical)

### Phase 3 Prerequisites
- [ ] **Phases 1-2 completed** successfully  
- [ ] **API knowledge** (materials route, login actions)
- [ ] **Type system understanding** (imports and exports)

### Phase 4 Prerequisites
- [ ] **All code fixes completed** (phases 1-3)
- [ ] **Zero compilation errors** verified
- [ ] **Database ready** for schema creation

### Phase 5 Prerequisites
- [ ] **Database setup completed** (phase 4)
- [ ] **Seed data inserted** successfully
- [ ] **Testing strategy** ready

## üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY MEASURES

### Automatic Safeguards in Place
‚úÖ **safe-seed.ts** - Won't seed if data exists  
‚úÖ **ensure-clean-database.ts** - Can clean if needed  
‚úÖ **check-database-state.ts** - Monitor progress  
‚úÖ **Phase-by-phase** approach - Can stop at any point  

### Manual Safety Checks
- **After each phase:** Run TypeScript compilation check
- **Before database operations:** Verify clean state
- **After seeding:** Check row counts make sense
- **Before production:** Full application test

## üöÄ EXECUTION APPROVAL CRITERIA

### Technical Approval
- [x] All TypeScript errors identified and planned for fixing
- [x] Database connection verified and clean
- [x] Environment variables confirmed
- [x] Execution plan reviewed and understood

### Risk Approval  
- [x] High-risk tasks identified (booking/lesson seeding, login actions)
- [x] Mitigation strategies in place (phase-by-phase, validation)
- [x] Rollback plan understood (phase independence)
- [x] Success criteria defined clearly

### Process Approval
- [x] Requirements checklist completed
- [x] Execution plan created and reviewed
- [ ] **USER CONFIRMATION**: Ready to proceed with Phase 1?
