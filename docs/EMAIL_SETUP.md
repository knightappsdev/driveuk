# üìß Email Setup Guide

This guide will help you configure email functionality for your driving school website to capture form submissions and send automated responses.

## üìã Overview

The email system captures all form submissions and sends them to **dsforms@ofemo.uk**, while automated responses are sent from **support@ofemo.uk** to provide professional customer service.

## üîß Setup Steps

### 1. Get a Resend API Key

1. Visit [Resend.com](https://resend.com) and create an account
2. Go to [API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys) 
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the API key (it starts with `re_`)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Update your `.env` file with your Resend API key:

```bash
# Email Configuration (Resend API)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. Domain Verification (Production Only)

For production use, you'll need to verify your domain with Resend:

1. In your Resend dashboard, go to **Domains**
2. Add your domain (e.g., `ofemo.uk`)
3. Add the provided DNS records to your domain
4. Wait for verification (usually takes a few minutes)

**Note:** For development/testing, you can use the default `noreply@resend.dev` sender.

### 4. Update Email Addresses (Optional)

If you want to use different email addresses, update the configuration in `lib/email/config.ts`:

```typescript
export const EMAIL_CONFIG = {
  // Where form submissions are sent
  FORM_RECIPIENT: 'your-forms@yourdomain.com',
  // Where automated responses come from  
  SUPPORT_SENDER: 'support@yourdomain.com',
  // Fallback sender (always works)
  FALLBACK_SENDER: 'noreply@resend.dev',
} as const;
```

### 2. Check Email Delivery

1. Monitor your `dsforms@ofemo.uk` inbox for form submissions
2. Check that customers receive auto-responses from `support@ofemo.uk`
3. Verify emails are not going to spam folders

### 3. API Testing

You can also test the API directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/email/send-form \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "general-inquiry",
    "data": {
      "name": "Test User",
      "email": "test@example.com",
      "message": "This is a test message"
    },
    "customerEmail": "test@example.com"
  }'
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Missing API Key" Error**
   - Ensure `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in your `.env` file
   - Verify the API key starts with `re_`

2. **Emails Not Sending**
   - Check your Resend dashboard for error logs
   - Verify domain is properly configured for production
   - Ensure sender email is verified

3. **Auto-Responses Not Received**
